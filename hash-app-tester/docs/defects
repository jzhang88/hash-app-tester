Bug1: POST hash does not return 200 immediately. It only returns after 5 seconds when hashing is done
Bug2: POST hash without password returns 200 OK
Bug3: POST hash with wrong header returns 200 OK
Bug4: POST /stats returns 200 OK (expected 405. missing req)
Bug5: PUT /stats returns 200 OK (expected 405. missing req)
Bug6: DELETE /stats returns 200 OK (expected 405. missing req)

Bug7: POST shutdown does not return 200 OK when there is no in-flight hashing.
	  It stops the app immediately and results in http connection error on client side
Bug8: GET /stats always returns AverageTime as 0 in response json
		-run 1 post at a time
		{"TotalRequests":5,"AverageTime":0}
		{"TotalRequests":25,"AverageTime":0}
		{"TotalRequests":44,"AverageTime":0}
		{"TotalRequests":116,"AverageTime":0}
		
		- run 5 post in parallel
		{"TotalRequests":30,"AverageTime":0}
		{"TotalRequests":50,"AverageTime":0}


		- start the app and run with 10 post in parallel. AverageTime is way off (>100 seconds in this case)
		{"TotalRequests":10,"AverageTime":100050}


Bug: Raw error returned by some invalid requests. E.g. Get hash with non-digital job id
	 sent: GET http://127.0.0.1:8088/hash/one
	 received: strconv.Atoi: parsing "one": invalid syntax
	 expected: formalized error message
