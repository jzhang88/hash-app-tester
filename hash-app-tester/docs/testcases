Start the app:
1000 verify the app starts on listens on the defined port env var
1010 verify the app does not start if PORT is not defined
1020 verify the app can start again after shutting down
1030 verify the app can start on different ports 

start the app twice on the same port???

POST:
2000 verify successful POST returns 200 OK and a job id
2010 verify successful POST returns a job id immediately
2020 verify job id starts with 1 for the first post
2030 verify job id increments by 1 for new posts (assume job id increment step is 1)
2040 verify post with empty password
2050 verify post with None password (400)
2060 verify post without password 
-2070 verify post with non-string password (400) (expected behavior TBD)
2080 verify post with long password (2048 chars) (missing req)
2090 verify post password hash with special chars
2100 verify post password in other languages (missing req: i18n support)
2110 verify post with invalid payload (400)
2120 verify post with invalid header??? missing req




GET base64 encoded password
- 3000 verify GET with a valid job id does not work within 5 seconds of hash????
3010 verify GET with a valid job id returns hashed password which was POSTed 5 seconds ago
3020 verify GET with a valid job id returns the correct password hash from encoded from SHA512 to BASE64
3030 verify GET returns hash for password with special characters
3040 verify GET returns hash for password with 2048 characters (missing req)
3050 verify GET returns hash for password in other language (i18n)
3060 verify GET with invalid job id return 400 Bad Request with message "Hash not found"
3070 verify GET with non-digital job id returns 400 Bad Request
3080 verify GET without job id is not supported(405)


GET the stats
4000 verify GET stats works when no jobs exist
4010 verify GET stats returns 200 OK and correct stats in json format
4020 verify GET stats returns updated job count and averageTime
 - TODO: add more tests to validate averageTime. Currently blocked by bug #8.



Not supported:
5000 verify PUT /hash is not supported (missing req: 405)
5010 verify DELETE /hash is not supported (missing req: 405)
5020 verify POST /hash/<id> is not supported (missing req: 405)
5030 verify PUT /hash/<id> is not supported (missing req: 405)
5040 verify DELETE /hash/<id> is not supported (missing req: 405)
5050 verify POST /stats is not supported (missing req: 405)
5060 verify PUT /stats is not supported (missing req: 405)
5070 verify DELETE /stats is not supported (missing req: 405)

POST Shutdown
6000 verify post shutdown stops the app immediately when there is no active hashing
6010 verify shutdown returns 200 OK then shutdown the app gracefully when there are hashing in progress
6020 verify any new request fails if the app has been shutdown(make sure it really shuts down)
6030 verify in-flight POST should complete before shutdown completes
6040 verify new POST should be rejected when the app is in pending shutdown state(400?)
6050 verify new post shutdown is rejected when shutdown is in progress (missing req)

Load/Perf:
7000 verify the app processes multiple hashing simultaneously

Misc (Not Automated):
Verify urls with tailing / returns error messages gracefully (missing req)
verify TotalRequests and AverageTime limit(missing req and data type)
Verify post with code injection
